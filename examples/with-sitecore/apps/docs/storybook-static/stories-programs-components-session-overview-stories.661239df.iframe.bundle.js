As a result, the implementation of mobility policy via traffic management is key to cater for the diverse needs of road users, road authorities, cities, and their inhabitants. Within the range of traffic management instruments, traffic lights can be one of the most efficient and effective solutions to accommodate the diverse needs of different mobility stakeholders. By using the new generation of intelligent traffic light installations (iTLIs), cities can harmonise traffic flows more efficiently, via dynamic traffic light controls. This reduces congestion and pollution, thereby saving time, fuel and CO2 emissions as well as money.
