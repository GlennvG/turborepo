As a result, the implementation of mobility policy via traffic management is key to cater for the diverse needs of road users, road authorities, cities, and their inhabitants. Within the range of traffic management instruments, traffic lights can be one of the most efficient and effective solutions to accommodate the diverse needs of different mobility stakeholders. By using the new generation of intelligent traffic light installations (iTLIs), cities can harmonise traffic flows more efficiently, via dynamic traffic light controls. This reduces congestion and pollution, thereby saving time, fuel and CO2 emissions as well as money. In this presentation, several use cases will illustrate how cities can put their policy into practice on the roads with the help of road users by utilizing new data sources and ITS technologies with award-winning Flowtack iTLI’s solution.",end_date:1713258e3,event_id:"0022357",id:"intertrafficams20240073",image_url:"https://www.intertraffic.com/amsterdam/-/media/3eab7b5b2bbd4b63b38ced98bebd8ba4.png",location:"Intertraffic Summit Theatre 1",start_date:1713256200,timezone_offset:72e5,title:"Managing today's and tomorrow's mobility by implementing policy",topic:"Traffic Management"}]},"./src/stories/programs/data/speaker-mock-data.ts":(__unused_webpack_module,__webpack_exports__,__webpack_require__)=>{__webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__,{U:()=>SpeakerMockData});const SpeakerMockData=[{company_name:"Yunex Traffic",description:"Jason Lu is the product manager for Yunex Traffic's traffic management system.
